Great question! Here's a practical roadmap for building out the Viticulture game, prioritizing core functionality and iterative development:

## **Phase 1: Core Game Mechanics (Weeks 1-4)**

### Week 1: Worker Placement Foundation [DONE]
- **Implement clickable action spaces** (replace keyboard with mouse)
- **Visual worker placement** (drag workers to action spaces)
- **Action space validation** (check availability, player turn)
- **Basic worker pool management** (track placed/available workers)

### Week 2: Card System [DONE]
- **Card data structures** (expand VineCard/WineOrderCard)
- **Deck management** (shuffling, drawing)
- **Hand visualization** (simple card display)
- **Card playing mechanics** (plant vines, fulfill orders)

### Week 3: Vineyard Operations
- **Field planting system** (place vines in 3x3 grid)
- **Harvest mechanics** (convert vines to grapes)
- **Wine production** (grapes → wine conversion)
- **Basic resource management** (lira, grapes, wine storage)

### Week 4: Victory & Scoring
- **Order fulfillment system** (match wine to orders)
- **Victory point tracking** (real-time score updates)
- **End game conditions** (20 VP trigger)
- **Basic game flow polish**

## **Phase 2: UI & Visual Polish (Weeks 5-8)**

### Week 5: Proper UI System
- **Replace gizmos with UI panels** (egui or Bevy UI)
- **Player dashboards** (resources, VP, cards)
- **Action board layout** (visual action spaces)
- **Turn indicators** (clear current player display)

### Week 6: Visual Assets
- **Sprite system setup** (placeholder art → proper sprites)
- **Card visuals** (card backgrounds, text rendering)
- **Vineyard board graphics** (field grid, wine cellar)
- **Worker meeple sprites**

### Week 7: Animations
- **Worker movement** (smooth placement animations)
- **Card transitions** (draw, play, discard)
- **Resource changes** (score increases, grape/wine gains)
- **Seasonal transitions** (visual phase changes)

### Week 8: Polish & Juice
- **Sound effects** (placement, card draw, scoring)
- **Hover effects** (highlight valid actions)
- **Visual feedback** (success/error states)
- **Basic particle effects** (harvest, wine making)

## **Phase 3: Complete Game Rules (Weeks 9-12)**

### Week 9: Advanced Mechanics
- **Structures system** (buildings with ongoing effects)
- **Visitor cards** (if including Tuscany expansion)
- **Grande worker rules** (bypass placement restrictions)
- **Wake-up order benefits** (spring phase rewards)

### Week 10: Full Action Set
- **All summer actions** (tours, selling grapes, etc.)
- **All winter actions** (training workers, etc.)
- **Action bonuses** (bonus worker spaces)
- **Complex wine types** (blush, sparkling wines)

### Week 11: Game Balance
- **AI opponent** (basic rule-following AI)
- **Difficulty scaling** (beginner → intermediate AI)
- **Rule validation** (prevent illegal moves)
- **Edge case handling** (tie-breakers, etc.)

### Week 12: Testing & Polish
- **Full game playtesting**
- **Bug fixes and optimization**
- **Rules compliance verification**
- **Performance optimization**

## **Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 13-16)**

### Week 13: Save/Load System
- **Game state serialization**
- **Save/load functionality**
- **Game replay system**
- **Statistics tracking**

### Week 14: Multiplayer Foundation
- **Hot-seat multiplayer** (local pass-and-play)
- **Network architecture setup**
- **Basic client-server model**
- **Turn synchronization**

### Week 15: AI Improvements
- **Strategic AI** (medium difficulty)
- **Advanced AI** (competitive play)
- **AI personality variations**
- **Difficulty selection**

### Week 16: Polish & Release Prep
- **Tutorial system** (guided first game)
- **Settings menu** (audio, graphics options)
- **Achievement system**
- **Final optimization and packaging**

## **Immediate Next Steps (This Week)**

1. **Replace keyboard input with mouse clicking**
   ```rust
   // Add to systems.rs
   pub fn mouse_input_system(
       mouse_input: Res<ButtonInput<MouseButton>>,
       windows: Query<&Window>,
       camera: Query<(&Camera, &GlobalTransform)>,
   ) {
       // Convert mouse clicks to world coordinates
       // Detect action space clicks
       // Handle worker placement
   }
   ```

2. **Add clickable action spaces**
   ```rust
   #[derive(Component)]
   pub struct Clickable {
       pub bounds: Rect,
       pub action: ActionSpace,
   }
   ```

3. **Visual worker representation**
   ```rust
   #[derive(Component)]
   pub struct WorkerSprite {
       pub owner: PlayerId,
       pub position: Vec2,
       pub is_placed: bool,
   }
   ```

## **Success Metrics**
- **Week 4**: Playable core game loop
- **Week 8**: Visually appealing and smooth
- **Week 12**: Complete rule implementation
- **Week 16**: Polish and feature-complete
